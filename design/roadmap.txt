*** Release planning ***

Prototype
- Runs from shell w/ input
- Crawls pages while avoiding HTTP 403
- Downloads plot plans to a directory

Scale
- Edge cases to consider:
    - Multiple plot plans in View Attachments
    - No plot plans in View Attachments
- Reduce time delays
- Form file naming: 
    - PolyID + date from View Attachments page + og name
- Polygons-LandUnits map read and fed to the spider on init
- Many user inputs are queued by reading from a file

Batch
- Sequentially batch processing with configurable batch size

Batch 2 (Aborted, needs refactoring)
- log all events
    - Landunits covered & remaining
    - Polygons covered & remaining
- Save all logs and print statements
- Custom start and endpoint

Refactor
- Across the repo...
    - Improve configurability
    - Group repeated functionalities in classes or utils
    - Improve run time
- Reduce logging

Tracking
- Use SQLite Export CSV with stats on
    - # of Total plotplan for a LandUnit/Polygon
    - # of Downloaded plotplan for a LandUnit/Polygon
    - # of Not-Downloaded plotplan for a LandUnit/Polygon
- Steps
    - Initialize a table for Polygon LandUnit relation used for lookup
    - In every crawl, add associate plotplan to Landunit
    - Join tables to make a giant stats page and export to excel or csv

Testing
- Test suite running Unit and integration tests, where applicable

Batch 3
- Auto allocate landunits/Polygon to batches
- Custom allocate landunits/Polygon to batches
- Track batches completed and remaining
- Pause and Resume batch
- Restore (from failure) batch execution
