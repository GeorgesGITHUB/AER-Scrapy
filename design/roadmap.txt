Release planning

Prototype
- Runs from shell w/ input
- Crawls pages while avoiding HTTP 403
- Downloads plot plans to a directory

Scale
- Edge cases to consider:
    - Multiple plot plans in View Attachments
    - No plot plans in View Attachments
- Reduce time delays
- Form file naming: 
    - PolyID + date from View Attachments page + og name
- List of Polygons - Land Units association read and fed to the spider on init
- Many user inputs are queued by reading from a file

Batch
- Sequentially batch processing with configurable batch size

Batch 2
- log all events
    - step success/fail 
    - download success/fail
    - edge cases: duplicate downloads
    - Landunits covered
    - Landunits remaining
    - Polygons covered
    - Polygons remaining
- Save all logs and print statements
- Don't download if duplicate file
- Custom process start and endpoint
- Process only the landunits left
- Process only the polygons left

Refactor
- Scan the repo to make...
    - things configurable
    - debug statement more useful
    - Group repeated functionalities in functions and store in the class or in utils
    - logic optimizations or fast libraries for actions
- Use scrapy pipelines for transforms and other use cases

Features
- User Agent Rotator

QOL Features
- Log the number of plotplans downloaded per polygon
- plotplans will go in a subdirectory based on their associated polygon
